RWX storage is a special kind of storage that can be mounted on several pods at the same time.

With OCS, each RWX storage device is backed by the battle-tested and high-performance distributed filesystem known as CephFS.

This storage type is well suited for scalable applications that need a shared filesystem storage. An example of this are webservers that are dynamically scaled up and down based on the amount of visitors.

In this section the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` _Storage Class_ will be used to create a RWX (ReadWriteMany) PVC that can be used by multiple pods at the same time. The application we will use is called `File Uploader`.

Create a new project:

`oc new-project my-shared-storage`{{execute}}

Next deploy the example PHP application called `file-uploader`:

`oc new-app openshift/php:7.2-ubi8~https://github.com/christianh814/openshift-php-upload-demo --name=file-uploader`{{execute}}

#### Sample Output:

<pre>
--> Found image 343298a (4 months old) in image stream "openshift/php" under tag "7.2-ubi8" for "openshift/php:7.2-ubi8"

    Apache 2.4 with PHP 7.2
    -----------------------
    PHP 7.2 available as container is a base platform for building and running various PHP 7.2 applications and frameworks. PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.

      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "file-uploader:latest"

Push successful
</pre>

The command prompt returns out of the tail mode once you see _Push successful_.

---

**NOTE**

This use of the `new-app` command directly asked for application code to be
built and did not involve a template. That's why it only created a _single
Pod_ deployment with a _Service_ and no _Route_.

---

Let's make our application production ready by exposing it via a `Route` and scale to 3 instances for high availability:

`oc expose svc/file-uploader -n my-shared-storage`{{execute}}

`oc scale --replicas=3 deploy/file-uploader -n my-shared-storage`{{execute}}

`oc get pods -n my-shared-storage`{{execute}}

You should have 3 `file-uploader` _Pods_ in a few minutes. The additional `Route` allows us to access the application from outside of the Openshift cluster.

---

**CAUTION**

Never attempt to store persistent data in a _Pod_ that has no persistent
volume associated with it. _Pods_ and their containers are ephemeral by
definition, and any stored data will be lost as soon as the _Pod_ terminates
for whatever reason.

---

The app is of course not useful like this. We can fix this by providing shared
storage to this app.

You can create a _PersistentVolumeClaim_ and attach it into an application with
the `oc set volume` command. Execute the following

````
oc set volume deploy/file-uploader --add --name=my-shared-storage \
-t pvc --claim-mode=ReadWriteMany --claim-size=1Gi \
--claim-name=my-shared-storage --claim-class=ocs-storagecluster-cephfs \
--mount-path=/opt/app-root/src/uploaded \
-n my-shared-storage
```{{execute}}

This command will:

* create a *PersistentVolumeClaim*
* update the *DeploymentConfig* to include a `volume` definition
* update the *DeploymentConfig* to attach a `volumemount` into the specified `mount-path`
* cause a new deployment of the 3 application *Pods*

For more information on what `oc set volume` is capable of, look at its help output
with `oc set volume -h`. Now, let's look at the result of adding the volume:

`oc get pvc -n my-shared-storage`{{execute}}

#### Sample Output:

<pre>
NAME                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS                AGE
my-shared-storage   Bound    pvc-371c2184-fb73-11e9-b901-0aad1a53052d   1Gi        RWX            ocs-storagecluster-cephfs   47s
</pre>

Notice the `ACCESSMODE` being set to *RWX* (short for `ReadWriteMany`).

All 3 `file-uploader`*Pods* are using the same *RWX* volume. Without this `ACCESSMODE`, OpenShift will not attempt to attach multiple *Pods* to the same *PersistentVolume*
reliably. If you attempt to scale up deployments that are using *RWO* or `ReadWriteOnce` storage, the *Pods* will actually all become co-located on the same
node.

If you want to clean your screen before continuing, just execute:
`clear`{{execute}}
